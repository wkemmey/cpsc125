## Required Text

_A Cool Brisk Walk through Discrete Mathematics_ by Stephen Davies, Ph.D.
http://allthemath.org

Please don't print this on UMW printers.

Material from the text may not be covered in its entirety.  Material presented during lectures may also be drawn from or supplemented by sources other than the text.

## Course Objectives

1. Students will demonstrate an ability to interpret quantitative/symbolic infor-
mation.
2. Students will have the ability to convert relevant information into various math-
ematical/analytical forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)
3. Students will be able to apply analytical techniques or rules to solve problems
in a variety of contexts.
4. Students will gain an appreciation for how analytical techniques or rules are
used to address real-world problems across multiple disciplines.
5. Students will gain fl
uency with mathematical and analytic structures necessary
for future courses in computer science.
6. Students will improve computational thinking skills.

## Rules of the Game

- Ask questions.  Raise your hand if I'm in the middle of something, but if I don't notice, just interrupt.

- Join in class discussions.  Let's figure some things out together.  I don't care if you're wrong.

- Be patient while I learn your names.  If I point to you in class, say your first name.

- Don't cheat.  Come to me if you are struggling.  You need to understand this material; you will definitely use it.

- Sit in the back if you want to use a laptop.  Don't distract your classmates.

## Homework

I don't collect or grade homework.  It's for you.

Quiz questions will be similar to the homework.  Alternatively, quiz questions may draw from reading assignments.

## Grading

### Exams

There will be two exams during the semester, a midterm and a final exam.  The final exam will not be intentionally comprehensive, but due to the successive nature of the material, an exam may cover materials that were tested on a previous exam.  No makeup exams will be given except in the case of an unavoidable absense which can be verified as legitimate.

Only very basic calculators (those that do not include trigonometric functions) may be used on exams.  Students are encouraged to obtain one of these and practice using it for calculations prior to scheduled exams.

Each exam is 30% of your grade, for a total of 60% between the two exams.

### Quizzes, Projects, and Responsive Readings

Short quizzes will be given during class several times throughout the semester; these will be very brief, and you will have to be somewhat familiar with the problems to complete them in a timely manner.  Work some homework problems; that is the best preparation for quizzes!

Each quiz will be worth a small number of points (usually 6-10 points each), but only points above the 50% mark will be added to your grade.  The things I am trying to accomplish doing quizzes this way:

- Encourage homework, but allow you to choose how much you need to learn the material.

- Allow you to demonstrate mastery of the material weekly, as well as on exams.

- Allow me to gage the progress of the class, and my effectiveness in conveying the material.

There will be several opportunities for small projects and responsive readings outside of class.  Grades on these assignments will be added to your grade for the semester.

This grading policy means several things:

- There is no makeup for missed quizzes.

- Projects and responsive readings are not accepted late.

- There are several approaches to getting an A in the course.

- Doing badly on one assignment does not doom your grade.

In addition to homework, quizzes are good preparation for the exams.  If you are not doing well on the quizzes, come see me for help!

## The Honor Code and this Course

Violating the honor code is unfair to your classmates and unfair to yourself.  Don't do it.

Quizzes and exams will be administered in class.  All work must be your own.  Any form of assistance from peers or reference materials is cheating.

Other than quizzes and exams, however, feel free to work together, ask questions of your fellow students, and look things up on the internet.  Do whatever works best for your own personal learning style.  Just don't take shortcuts that deprive you of the opportunity to learn.  It won't be cheating if you do, it just won't be smart.

## Late policy

Assignments are not accepted late.  They are due at midnight EST on the due date.


## Basis for determining mid-semester reports

For midterm progress reports, I will look at graded asssignments so far.  For quizzes, I will calculate an interim grade based on points achieved out of points possible, even though that is not the way quizzes will be applied to your final grade.  If your grade is below a C, it's a sign of danger, and I will give you a \U" for your mid-semester grade. Please don't hesitate at all to come talk to me about this so we can figure out how you can do better in the course.

## Disabilities

If you have a documented disability, please present me your letter from the Office of Disability
Resources and I'll be happy to accommodate you.

## How to reach me

By far the best way to reach me is to see me after class, or e-mail me.

## How to reach you

I will be communicating with you outside of class time via e-mail, so make sure to check your UMW
e-mail every day! I will also post announcements to the course website, so be sure to check it a few times a week!
